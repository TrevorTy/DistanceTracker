# DistanceTracker
-----> This sofware is not meant to be used in Production! <-----

This app keeps track of your walked distance and your goals.

The backend is in .net core 3.1 Web Api and the frontend is in Angular 8/9.
If you want to actually use this project you might have to modify some stuff, because it most likely wont work right away.
It has to be refactored a bit. (Desktop only)
